# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Andrew Moy*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on May 7th, 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included doing practice FRQs that came from previous years' AP exam.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were being limited by time, and reading comprehension.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me were giving myself a time goal, and taking a minute to focus on the question within the time frame.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions were not something that I considered when taking the test.

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified the following areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: 2D Arrays.
- Topic/Concept 2: Polymorphism.
- Programming practice: Daily FRQs & MCQs.

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review are the following:

- CollegeBoard (https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions)
- AP Classroom
  
## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to do the following:
- Learn more about what I learned from class and putting it into practice.
- Create my own program.
- Not forget what I learned this year.
