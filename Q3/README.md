## Question 2 Analysis
### Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Despite the time of the exam and the time of my review having a little less than a week in between the dates, I still forgot a large majority of what went through my head when I took the test. However, I vaguely remember using a for loop to initialize the result ArrayList.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I instead started using an enhanced for loop, as opposed to a regular for loop. This action saves lines and time when being compared to my previous response during the test.
