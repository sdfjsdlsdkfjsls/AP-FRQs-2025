## Question 3 Analysis
### Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Despite the time of the exam and the time of my review having a little less than a week in between the dates, I still forgot a large majority of what went through my head when I took the test. However, I vaguely remember using a for loop to initialize the result ArrayList. I used the "i" in the for loop as the rank for competitors, however, this caused complications because rank 1 would not be the same as index 1. There were also similar complications doing part B, however, I think I managed to make it work.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- For part A, I instead started using an enhanced for loop, as opposed to a regular for loop. This action saves lines and time when being compared to my previous response during the test. My response for part B is relatively the same as it was during the exam.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Usage of for loops & enhanced for loops.
- Initialization of ArrayLists.
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- It's easy to do things and say they're good, but in hindsight, they might end up being worse than what should've been done in the first place. This is similar to how I felt using the for loop and switching to the enhanced for loop.
