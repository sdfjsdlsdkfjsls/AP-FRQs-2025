## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Knowing that my end result was to call updateDogs() as well as to return a number of dogs, I chose to have both together at the end of the method. I chose to create a variable at the start of the method to keep track of how many dogs were going to be return and updated, and then run them together minimizing redundancy.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- After reviewing, I saw no reason to change/revise my solution.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- The primary concepts that I tested in this question were the following: calling methods from other classed, declaring and updating a variable, and minimizing redundancy.
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I feel as if revisiting the problem didn't provide much to me. All I obtained from this was clarity, knowing that my answer would've been sufficient.
