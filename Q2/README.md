## Question 2 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- When creating the SignedText class, I read the prompt while creating each individual part of the class together one by one. This was a big mistake on my part because instead of saving time, it took more time because I was making and revising the class while not having a full understanding of what it was supposed to do. I was left confused multiple times during the question and I should've just taken the time to read everything before starting.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I believe my previous and revised solutions are very similar and lack any changes.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Usage of "if" statements.
- Usage of indexOf().
- String appending.
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- The question is in essence less complicated than how I had originally perceived it. Perhaps it was the stress during the exam or maybe it was my lack of understanding for the question, but now I understand and it was much easier to redo outside of the exam.
